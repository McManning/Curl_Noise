# OpenGL Particles with Curl Noise
Implementation of curl noise for particles simulated on GPU with OpenGL

The implementation of curl noise is based on the paper by Robert Bridson, Jim Hourihan and Marcus Nordenstam https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph2007-curlnoise.pdf.

The software implementation of simplex noise used comes from https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/wiki
