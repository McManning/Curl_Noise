# curl_noise
Implementation of curl noise for particles simulated on GPU with OpenGL

The implementation is based on the paper by Robert Bridson, Jim Hourihan and Marcus Nordenstam https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph2007-curlnoise.pdf.

The software implementation of simplex noise used comes from https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/wiki
